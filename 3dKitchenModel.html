            <p>
                This model was the culmination of my final project for a computer 
                graphics course. The goal was to integrate the year's learning on 
                topics such as transformations, geometry, lighting, and texture 
                properties into one cohesive design. 
                
            <p>Continue reading for a 
                detailed breakdown.
            </p>
                
            <p> I designed an entryway scene leading into a kitchen, featuring 
                wooden-textured counters and cabinets with marble countertops, 
                a sink, and tile accents between the counters. The kitchen elements 
                were made using cylinders and flat surfaces. To the left of the 
                viewpoint is a table with two stool chairs, all created from 
                cylinders, with straw-textured chair tops. The walls have an 
                artsy texture and a screen door texture with a mock outside view. 
                The floor is light wood, and the scene includes three light 
                sources: one simulating indoor lighting, and two representing 
                day and night light coming from outside. All colors, textures, 
                and lighting were chosen to complement the scene's theme.
